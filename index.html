            <p style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: lighter;">  As you probably guessed from that enormous headline , I'm a self taught web developer from <br> Greater Manchester who changed careers  after 
                 studying Spanish at the University of Chester (2.2 BA hons) <br> 
                <p style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: lighter;">- I have a passion for the subject matter involved in language studies 
                and found that programming <br> is highly compatible with the syntax of language, as well as a great outlet for creativity <br></p>
                <p style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: lighter;">-My primary focus is on HTML, CSS and Javascript as it's important to have confidence <br> and understanding of the fundamentals, but i would appreciate the opportunity to learn <br>
                about backend development, API's, javascript frameworks and cybersecurity. <br> </p>
                <p style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: lighter;">Thank you for checking out my portfolio today. Please find attached my resume for more information. <br>
